export const participationAgreement = 'This Volunteer Participation Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into by and between One Heart Source, a California non-profit corporation with its principal offices at: P.O. Box \n24293 Los Angeles, CA, 90024  (“OHS”), and ____________________________(name), a Volunteer with his\/her residential address at _______________________(street) ______________________(city) _____________________________(state\/province) ________________________________(Country) ________________ (postal code) (“Volunteer”).\n\nWHEREAS, OHS is a not-for profit with its objective being to lessen the gap between those who have access to bettering their lives and those who do not, with a specific focus on providing education and care to vulnerable children in order to empower opportunity, choice, and freedom.\n\nWHEREAS, the Volunteer is desirous to participate in the various volunteer programs offered by OHS and does so pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (“Volunteer Program”);\n\nNOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties execute this in agreement of the terms and conditions stated herein:\n\nDefinitions\n\nVolunteer - A \"volunteer\" is anyone who, without compensation or expectation of compensation beyond reimbursement, performs a task at the direction of and on behalf of OHS.  A \"volunteer\" must be officially accepted and enrolled by OHS prior to performance of the task. Unless specifically stated, volunteers shall not be considered as \"employees\" of OHS.\n\nThe following TERMS AND CONDITIONS apply to all One Heart Source Programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI. Personal health and safety considerations\n\nI, the Volunteer, will obtain a policy of comprehensive medical, travel, and\/or accident insurance for the period that I am participating in the Program, which should have minimum Policy limits of $250,000. (the “Policy”).  The Policy will provide coverage for injuries and illnesses I may sustain or experience in the Program countries and those in which I will live or through which I will travel while on the Program. I certify that the Policy will adequately cover me while outside my home country and includes coverage for emergency evacuation and repatriation.  I also hereby release One Heart Source (“OHS”), the university at which I am matriculated, the State of California, and their agents officers, directors, employees, heirs and assigns, successors in interest from all responsibility and liability for any injuries (including death), illness, claims, damages, charges, bills, or expenses I may incur while I am abroad whether incurred due to the negligence of OHS or not.  I assume full responsibility and liability for any injuries (including death), illness, claims, damages, charges, bills, or other expenses I may incur while I am abroad whether incurred due to the negligence of OHS or not.  \n\nI am aware of all of my applicable personal medical needs and, at least 40 days prior to departure, I will report, in writing to OHS any physical or mental condition that may affect my participation in any OHS-organized Program. \n\nI have arranged, through insurance or otherwise, to pay for all of my medical expenses during my participation in this Program.  I agree to pay for any immunization services, agreed medical check ups and fulfill all conditions of the  required countries in which I will be resident or through which I will travel as part of this program.  \n\nI understand that any medical requirements and\/or restrictions placed on my participation in my Volunteer Program (including disabled persons’ access to facilities or availability of special accommodations for visually-impaired or deaf persons) are determined by the laws of the countries in which the Program is located and\/or by the policies or procedures of the institution(s) through which I have arranged for my volunteer Program.  I acknowledge that, with the exception of OHS-organized Programs, OHS is not responsible for securing or supporting any additional accommodations necessary for my participation in the Program I have chosen. \n\nI understand that OHS provides basic meals on the volunteer program, and that meals provided generally reflect the local cuisine. Some foods that are part of my regular diet at home may not be included, and any additional foods\/products that I require will be my personal responsibility to purchase, not that of OHS.  Vegetarians can be accommodated in OHS-provided meals, but Volunteers with more specific dietary requirements may need to supplement the included meals at their own expense. Volunteers with food allergies including but not limited to nut or dairy, must ensure that OHS is aware of the existence and severity of the allergy.  \n\nVolunteers may opt out of OHS-provided meals if they have made alternative plans, and in such instances no reimbursement for the foregone meal shall be issued by OHS.  No reimbursements will be made for Volunteers who miss scheduled meals.\n\nVolunteers must include dietary or religious restrictions on their Volunteer Information Sheet or notify OHS by email and confirm receipt of the same.  \n\nII. General travel advisory\n\n1. I understand that OHS assumes no responsibility or liability for any losses that I may incur arising from: any delays; delayed or changed departure or arrival times; fare changes; dishonors of hotel, airline, or vehicle rental reservations, missed carrier connections; sickness, disease, or injuries (including death); losses or damages arising from weather; strikes; acts of God; circumstances beyond the control of OHS; force majeure; war; quarantine; civil unrest; public health risks; criminal activity; terrorism; accident; damage to property; bankruptcies of airlines or accommodations, restaurants, transportation, or other service or for any substitution of hotels or of common carriers beyond OHS’s control, with or without notice, or for any additional expense occasioned by liability for my hotel, transfers, meal costs, or other expenses.\n\n2. My baggage and personal property are transported entirely at my risk, and OHS is not responsible for the loss of or damage to my baggage and\/or personal property while in transit, in residence, or in storage for the duration of my chosen Program.  I assume full responsibility and liability for any losses that I may incur arising from such events. \n\n3. I assume full responsibility and liability for any losses that may incur arising from: any delays; delayed or changed departure or arrival times; fare changes; dishonors of hotel, airline or vehicle rental reservations; missed carrier connections; sickness, disease, or injuries (including death); losses or damages arising from weather; strikes; acts of nature; circumstances beyond the control of OHS; force majeure; war; quarantine; civil unrest; public health risks; criminal activity; terrorism; accident; damage to property; bankruptcies of airlines or accommodations, restaurants, transportation, or other service or for any substitution of hotels or of common carriers beyond OHS’s control, with or without notice, or for any additional expense occasioned by any of these events.  If due to weather, flight schedules, or other uncontrollable factors, I am required to spend additional nights away from home of my intended destination, I assume full responsibility and liability for my hotel, transfers, meal costs, or other expenses.  \n\n4. I am aware and understand the risks and dangers of travel to, in, and around the Program countries, including but not limited to the dangers of my own health and personal safety posed by the use of public transportation and by civil unrest, political instability, terrorist, crime, violence, and disease.  I will examine and periodically review the US Consular information <http:\/\/www.state.gov\/> and the Centers for Disease Control information <http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/travel\/> website for information and updates regarding the risks of travel to these countries prior to my departure.  By my participation in the Program I assume, knowingly and voluntarily, each of these risks and all of the other risks that could arise out of or occur during my travel. \n\n5. OHS reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any Program it organizes or withdraw its support of my participation in the Program or any aspects of it prior to departure or after departure, requiring that I return to my country of origin, if OHS determines or believes that I or any person is or will be in danger if I continue in the Program or any aspect of it.  In such an event, no reimbursement will be made on program cost or other costs incurred.  I may, at the sole discretion of OHS be placed in an alternative program location, or transfer the program fee balance paid to a future program whose start date falls within 1 year of my original program’s start date.\n\n6.  Any Volunteer who voluntarily leaves, or is removed from the OHS Program before the scheduled completion of their full Program, will not be refunded by OHS for any portion of their Program costs, nor will they be permitted to re-join the Program at any time during the Program, including optional excursions and activities. OHS does not assume responsibility for any Volunteer once they have left the supervision of the OHS program staff. This policy includes any Volunteer being required to leave the OHS Program as requested by OHS staff for breach of contract, or for medical or personal reasons. \n\nIII. Responsibility for behavior \n\nI understand that each country has its own laws and standards of acceptable conduct, including dress, manners, morals, politics, drug and alcohol use, and behavior.  I recognize that behavior that violates those laws or standards can harm the relationship between the host country and the United States; the reputation of OHS and the host community, Program sponsors or co-sponsors; and my own health and safety.\n\nI will become informed of, and abide by, all such laws and standards for each country to or through which I will travel during the Program by reviewing the relevant travel guides and by consulting available US government resources at www.state.gov .  I assume full responsibility and liability for any consequences or violations thereof.  I also understand that OHS is not responsible for providing any assistance, legal or otherwise, in dealing with the laws or standards of foreign countries.  \n\nOHS reserves the right to decline to accept or retain me in any OHS-organized Program at any time if my actions or general behavior impedes the operation of OHS or the rights or welfare of any person.  I understand that I may be required to leave the Program at the sole discretion of OHS’s employees, agents, or representatives, and I may be referred to the appropriate officials for disciplinary or other action.  In such an event, no refund will be made for my program costs.  \n\nAt my own expense, I shall defend, indemnify and hold OHS harmless (including OHS’s directors, officers, employees, and agents) from and against any and all loss, liability, claims, suits, actions, proceedings, judgments, awards, damages and expenses (including attorney’s fees) that they, or any of them may incur or suffer by reason of my participation in OHS.\n\nI understand that I need to abide by the rules of the housing provider or body corporate of any premises rented by OHS for the purposes of volunteer accommodation, and will be personally liable for any damages to premises or vehicles rented or owned by OHS.\n\nI understand that, in order to protect the children whom we serve, and to provide a safe and healthy environment for all volunteers and children, One Heart Source may review relevant public documents regarding criminal activity relating to myself, or any person who is in contact with children.  One Heart Source may conduct background checks, and if I have any record of crimes against children, I will not be enrolled or retained as a volunteer.  I understand that this may include, but is not limited to, any of the following background screening mechanisms: employment reference check, personal reference check, personal interview, confirmation of education, local criminal record check, state criminal record check, FBI criminal record check, state central child\/dependent adult abuse registry check, state sex offender registry check, motor vehicle record check, professional disciplinary board background check, or, if I am not a U.S. resident or citizen, the relevant means of obtaining a background check or police certificate in my country of citizenship and\/or residence.\n\nFurthermore, I understand that if I am found to have any crimes against children, I will not be admitted or retained in an OHS volunteer program.  Other criminal records or additional information not specifically relating to children may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and One Heart Source reserves the right to deny a volunteer position at any time, for any reason, to anyone, should it be determined to be in the best interest of the child or other program participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Program Logistics\n\nFor OHS-organized Programs, I understand that OHS reserves the right to change the Program itinerary, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and neither OHS nor its co-organizers will be liable for any loss to me by reason of any cancellation or change.  OHS may substitute hotels, accommodations, transportation, or housing at any time for any reason.  Specific room and housing assignments are within the sole discretion of OHS and its co-organizers. \n\nThe Program itinerary is subject to modification and change by OHS.  Every reasonable effort will be made to operate the Program as planned; however, should unforeseen local or global events and conditions require our itinerary to be altered or cancelled, OHS reserves the right to do so for the safety and best interest of the group. \n\nIn the unlikely event of such a cancellation, no refund can be given by OHS.  However, OHS at its sole discretion can either: (i) issue Volunteer a nontransferable voucher for monies paid, valid towards an OHS Program within the following 1 year, or (ii) Volunteer may be reallocated to a different program location in the current Program season (subject to space availability).\n\nI understand that accommodations and housing that are provided by OHS during Programs may have some inherent risks that are beyond the control of OHS including but not limited to acts of nature, accident, sickness, terrorism, crime, theft.  OHS reserves the right to change or substitute housing at any time with or without notice.  Neither OHS nor its co-organizers will be liable for any loss to me by my residing in the rooms or housing assignment in which I am placed. \n\nI understand that transportation provided by OHS vehicles and other vehicles in the duration of the Program is taken at my own risk; and OHS assumes no responsibility or liability for any damages or losses that may occur from vehicle related injury accidents including death.  I will abide by the traffic and vehicle rules of the countries in which the Program is located and the additional traffic and vehicle rules set by OHS.  \n\nWeekend off time and\/or extra travel during the duration of the Program as well as pre\/post Program travel is not considered part of OHS-organized Programs.  The Program is the period of time including and between the start date and the end date, and any date before the start date or after the end date is not considered part of “The Program”.  I understand that I am free to choose to participate in and I assume full responsibility for any activities that I may engage in during weekend off time; and\/or extra travel accommodations, transportation, food, medical, injury (including death), and all other expenses incurred during weekend off time and\/or extra travel pre\/post program.  \n\n\nV. Media Rights\n\nI grant permission to OHS, and its agents or employees, to tape, video and\/or photograph me and record me or my projects.\n\nI authorize the use of my name, voice, photograph, likeness, performance and\/or biography, voice and conversation including quotes, paraphrases, sounds, and any performance or participation in OHS events, by OHS and their officers, employees and agents. I authorize OHS to obtain and hold copyrights in such Program and products, and to edit my performance and materials in its sole discretion.\n\nI understand that OHS has no obligation to release the tape, video and\/or photographs of my participation in the Volunteer Program, and that I will receive no monetary compensation for the rights granted herein. I also understand and agree that there will be no residual or any other type of payment, royalty or fee due in connection with such tapes, videos, podcasts, photographs and recordings. \n\nI also authorize the use of my name or, if I choose, a fictitious name, in connection with these photographs\/videos\/recordings and acknowledge OHS\'s right to copyright these materials, without compensation to me.\n\nI agree that OHS shall be the exclusive owner of all copyright and other rights in and to such taping, videos, photography and recording and will be able to license others to use them, in any manner and in any and all media now known or hereafter discovered or developed along with any incidental uses in connection with the merchandising and promotion of OHS.\n\nI further agree that One Heart Source may license others to use the tapes, videos, photographs and recordings or any excerpts thereof, including my name, image, voice, likeness and any related or derivative versions of this content for any purpose.\n\n\nI consent to and authorize the use, reproduction and publication by One Heart Source (OHS) of all forms of media content as created by me during OHS-organized programs, such as photographs, videos, reports, student projects, artworks, and any and all media. I also understand and agree that there will be no residual or any other type of payment, royalty or fee due in connection with such Media’s use. I expressly waive any and all rights I may have in connection with Media created by me on OHS-organized programs.\n\nI hereby agree to release, defend, and hold harmless One Heart Source and its agents, officers, directors or employees, including any firm publishing and\/or distributing the finished product in whole or in part, whether on paper or via electronic media, from and against any claims, damages or liability arising from or related to the use of said media, including but not limited to libel, false light, invasion of privacy, rights of publicity, any misuse, distortion, blurring, alteration, optical illusion or use in composite form, intentionally or otherwise, that may occur or be produced in taking, processing, reduction or production of the finished product, its publication or distribution.\n\nI am 18 years of age or older and I am competent to contract in my own name\n\nI understand and affirm that this Authorization and Release shall be considered consent to such use by OHS under the provisions of California Law and I expressly waive any and all rights in connection with any appearance. \n\nVI.  Payment Policy\n\nI acknowledge that in order to participate in an OHS Volunteer Program, I must complete the required program fee payment to One Heart Source by the program fee deadline, barring a situation in which there are specific circumstances outlined by a separate agreement between myself and OHS. \n\nProgram arrangements require OHS to make financial commitments on Volunteers’ behalf well in advance of the departure date. As such, the following policies apply in regards to deposit and program fee payments:\n\nA US $300 non-refundable deposit (the “Deposit”), payable by check or debit\/credit card, is due at the time of enrollment.  The Deposit is non-refundable and non-transferable once paid, under all circumstances.  The Deposit is NOT included in the Program Fee.\n\nIf a Volunteer is fundraising and would like an extension of their Deposit due date, they must inform the Finances Team and submit their Request for Deposit Extension Form before their Deposit due date in order to retain their position.  The volunteer may be given an extension option of paying $150  upon enrollment, and the additional $150 after two weeks, and still retain their position; or may be given the option of paying $100 every two weeks, over the course of six weeks, and still retain their position.  Should the volunteer fail to meet the conditions of the extension, their position will no longer be secured.\n\nThe Volunteer Program Fee is due on the applicable due date based on the 2016 Program Fee Algorithm, which is as follows:\n\nThe Program Fee is due no later than 90 days before the start date of the Volunteer’s Program, as submitted on the Program Selection Form.\n\nIf the Volunteer switches Programs, their program fee due date will change in accordance with the new Program’s start date, however, no donations or funds which have already been raised may be refunded or returned to the Volunteer at any time even in the event of a later program fee due date.  All Program switches will be subject to the conditions outlined in Section VII below.\n\nIf the Program Fee is not paid in full by the due date, and volunteer has not been granted an extended due date by OHS, the Volunteer will be cancelled from that program.  Volunteer will receive a Program cancellation notice and cancellation fees will apply (as specified in the Cancellation Policy outlined in Article VII, Section 3 below).\n\t\nOnce cancelled, Volunteer’s space on original program placement and\/or departure date is not guaranteed if Volunteer becomes reinstated. \n\nIn the event that I should still participate, partially or completely, in my chosen Program for any reason without having completed the program fee payment, I am still responsible for all Program costs, even after the program end date. I will pay such expenses from my own funds and will hold OHS harmless from any obligations irrespective of the date of or reason for my delay.\n\nIf a Volunteer is fundraising and would like an extension of their program fee due date, they must inform the Finances Team and submit the Request for Program Fee Extension Form.\n\nAn extension will be granted at the discretion of OHS only if at least 50% of the program fee has already been paid by the program fee due date associated with the Volunteer. \n\nAn extension will be granted at the discretion of OHS and requires the Volunteer’s program fee to be paid in full by a date agreed upon with the Finances Team, and no less than 30 days prior to the program start date. \n\nIn the event that the volunteer has not paid the program fee in full by the original due date, or the agreed-upon extended due date as confirmed by OHS, the volunteer’s position in 2016 programs will no longer be secured, and any funds raised will be automatically transferred to the next calendar year’s programs.  Any portion of the fee already paid will not be eligible for refund. \n\nI understand that all donations made towards my volunteer program fee via the OHS website or my personal Flipcause program fee fundraising page go directly to One Heart Source and are allocated towards my program fee fundraising, NOT to me personally for personal expenses such as travel, excursions, etc.\n\nIf a Volunteer is using a third party fundraising site (e.g. GoFundMe), it is their responsibility to review the Terms & Conditions of the third party fundraising site to ensure that their Program Fee is paid in full by the due date.  OHS cannot refund nor issue tax receipts to donations made through third party fundraising sites.\n\nOHS reserves the right to reject donations solicited by volunteers who claim that contributions will be used for purposes other than fundraising the Program Fee or donating to other published OHS projects.\n\nIf a Volunteer is fundraising, all contributions from sponsors must be received by OHS no later than the program fee deadline.  If additional funds are received after the start date, the total amount of those funds can be held on file, at Volunteer’s request, for one year from the original program start date to be applied toward another OHS Program within the following 1 year. No portion of fundraised funds is eligible for refund or transferable.\n\nIf Volunteer has fundraised over the amount of the Program Fee, or under any circumstance, the initial US$300 deposit is not eligible for refund. \n\nVII. Cancellation and Refund Policy\n\nIf a Volunteer cancels for any reason, the Volunteer must notify OHS in writing. No verbal cancellations will be accepted.   The cancellation will be effective upon OHS’s confirmation of receipt of the written notification, and volunteer will be issued a cancellation confirmation and reference code from OHS.  \n\nIf Volunteer chooses for any reason to cancel their participation in the program, they must inform both OHS and his\/her travel insurance provider of cancellation.  Whether or not the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of the Volunteer\'s insurance policy, or whether or not the Volunteer’s insurance claim is denied, is not the responsibility of OHS.\n\nDenial by Volunteer’s insurance provider and submission of the same to OHS is in no way a guarantee of a refund to be paid from OHS.\n\nOHS incurs substantial preparation and planning costs prior to the departure of a Volunteer. Therefore, if a Volunteer cancels his or her participation in the OHS program:\n\nThe US$300 non-refundable deposit will not be refunded under any circumstance.  Volunteer may apply the $300 deposit towards another OHS program to be scheduled within 12 months of the original start date, subject to space availability.\n\nDonations towards a volunteer’s program fee fundraising campaign are donations made to OHS, and, therefore, cannot be refunded in the event that the volunteer cancels their participation in the program.  However, the program fee paid, or portion thereof, may be held by OHS for a maximum of 1 year to be allocated towards their participation in a 2017 program.\n\nI understand that the above policies are in place because OHS makes financial commitments on behalf of volunteers as soon as they secure their spot by paying the Deposit, and the amount of preparation and planning costs associated with each volunteer increases as the program draws nearer.\n\nIf a Volunteer has cancelled his\/her program, he\/she has the option to leave any paid funds on file for up to one year from the original start date toward another OHS program.\n\nIt is very important that a Volunteer understands the cancellation policy, as it pertains to both the deposit and the program fee. If it is not clear, the Volunteer should ask for clarification. OHS cannot make exceptions to this cancellation policy for any reason, including medical emergencies. OHS strongly urges the Volunteer to purchase trip cancellation insurance.\n\nIn the event that the volunteer participates in the program but either arrives after the program start date or departs before the program end date, no refunds will be given for unused portions of the program or because of a Volunteer’s failure or inability to participate in the OHS program.\n\nThe Volunteer is also solely responsible for any airfare or other travel fees, charges, expenses or penalties, that might result from any cancellation of or change in the Volunteer’s program, whether the Volunteer cancels the program or it is cancelled or altered by OHS.\n\nThe Program Fee, or portions paid thereof, is not transferrable to another OHS volunteer.\n\n\nVIII. Changes to Program Start Date or Program Site\n\nOHS allows Volunteers to switch their program start date or program location, dependent on program availability. In addition, Volunteers are able to use their deposit on file or funds on file, as per the cancellation and refund policy in Article VII above, to enroll in a new program site and\/or program start date.\n\nIf a Volunteer chooses to switch his\/her program start date or program site (or cancel their program and re-enroll using funds on file or a deposit on file) more than 90 days before the original start date, OHS will waive the Switch Fee, one time only.\n\nIn the event of any additional switches, even if still more than 90 days before the program fee start date, OHS will assess a US $100, non-refundable switch fee.\n \nIf a Volunteer chooses to switch his\/her program start date or program site (or cancel their program and re-enroll using funds on file or a deposit on file) less than 90 days before the original start date, a non-refundable \tUS$200 Switch Fee will be assessed, even if this is the volunteer’s first switch.\n\nThe Switch Fee (or cancellation and re-enrollment using funds on file or deposit on file) is non-refundable and non-transferrable to any other programs.  The Switch Fee is assessed at the time of re-enrollment or at the time the switch is made, and is charged to the Volunteer whether or not the Program Fee balance has been paid in its entirety.\n\nIn all instances, a Program Switch may only be granted at the discretion of OHS, and is subject to availability in the desired program date\/location.\n\n\nIX. Volunteer Forms \n\nAll required Logistics Forms and Documents must be received in full by OHS no later than the due date specified by the Logistics Team.  OHS cannot accept any volunteer on a program without full completion of all Forms by said date.\n\nOHS reserves the right to cancel the Volunteer’s program spot without refund if fully completed Logistics Forms and Documents are not received by the due date.\n\n\nX. Declaration\n\nI hereby acknowledge that I have read, understand, and will abide by each of the terms and conditions of this agreement.  I further state that I am of legal age to accept these responsibilities.  \n\nIt is my express intent that this agreement shall bind the members of my family, if I am alive, and my heirs, assigns and personal representative, if I am deceased, and shall be deemed as a Release, Waiver, Discharge and Covenant Not to Sue OHS.\n\nChoice of Law.\nThe validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, applicable to agreements made and to be fully performed therein, without regard to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness.  In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator(s) may require for the making of an award.  Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above.\n\nEntire Agreement\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties as to the subject matter hereof and may not be modified, amended or terminated except by written agreement signed by the Parties.
